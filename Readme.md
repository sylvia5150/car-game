# Car Game #

<p> Hello! Welcome to my implementation of the classic game "Frogger". In this version, you must navigate your car across the road to the other side of your screen. But beware! The street is full of traffic! In order to complete the game, you must avoid hitting the other cars. </p>

## Current Limititations ##
<p> Currently, your car cannot screen-warp. That is, your car is not allowed to leave one side of the screen and appear on the other. This may change in a future update. </P>
<p> In addiion, if you do lose, the game does not stop. This means that the screen still updates behind the "Game Over" banner, and will continue updating until the user either restarts or closes the application. At this time, this does not pose any significant hinderence to the user, however this bug will need to be addressed if we are to enable a score tracking feature. </p>
